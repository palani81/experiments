# NAS Explorer - Categorization Rules
# These rules are built into the categorizer.py module.
# This file documents the rules and can be extended in future versions.
#
# Current built-in rules:
#
# 1. Extension-based: Maps 100+ file extensions to tags
#    (video, audio, music, image, photo, document, code, archive, data, etc.)
#
# 2. MIME-based: Fallback categorization by MIME type prefix
#    (video/*, audio/*, image/*, text/*)
#
# 3. Size-based:
#    - "large": >= 1 GB
#    - "huge": >= 10 GB
#    - "empty": 0 bytes
#
# 4. Age-based:
#    - "old": not modified in 3+ years
#
# 5. Name-based heuristics:
#    - "hidden": starts with .
#    - "backup": contains backup, bak, old, copy
#    - "temporary": contains temp, tmp, cache
#    - "documentation": contains readme, changelog, license
#    - "screenshot": contains screenshot, screen shot, capture
#
# Future: This file will support custom user rules in YAML format.
