# Experiments

**By Palani** — problem solver, tinkerer, and a firm believer that the best way to learn is to build.

This is my public playground for generative AI projects. I use AI as a collaborator to go from idea to working prototype — fast. Some of these are polished, some are held together with duct tape and curiosity. That's the point.

If something here sparks an idea or saves you time, that's a win.

## Projects

- **nas-explorer** — A self-hosted web app for browsing, searching, and organizing files on a Synology NAS. Built with FastAPI, React, and Docker. Features pure SMB access (no OS mounting needed), encrypted credential storage, multi-share management, full-text search, and media previews.
